**Develop an algorithm to read serial bit stream and generate output**
if below condition has occurred.

1. Light up led_1 if you detect more than 1 occurring of 01001010 pattern.
2. Blink led_1 if you detect more than 2 occurring of 01001010 pattern.
3. Light up led_2 if you detect more than 2 occurring of 00 pattern.
4. Blink led_2 if you detect more than 4 occurring of 00 pattern.

**Design a 4bit full adder using verilog**

Used Verilog language 

Testbench to verify the design

**Design an inventory management database**
Based on these requirements 

1. There are 10 different food items in a store.
2. You have to design a system to store no of products and output the total no of products and no of
products per food item when required.
3. 1bit output to indicate system is ready to take data.
4. input to select a food item.
5. 1bit input to insert a item into database.
6. 1bit input to get the total count.
7. output to indicate the total count. (assume max total count as 100)
8. 1bit output to indicate a valid output.

**Simulate in Vivado Software | verilog language**
